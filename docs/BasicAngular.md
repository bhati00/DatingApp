**<u>Basic concepts of Angular</u>**
Components: Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. They are reusable pieces of code that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. Each component consists of two parts: a class and a template. The class contains the logic that defines how the component works, while the template defines the layout and appearance of the component.

Directives: Directives are special HTML attributes that allow you to add behavior to existing HTML elements. Angular comes with several built-in directives, such as ngIf and ngFor. ngIf is used to conditionally show or hide an element, while ngFor is used to repeat an element for each item in a collection.

Services: Services are used to share functionality across different parts of an Angular application. They are typically used to perform tasks that are not directly related to the presentation layer, such as retrieving data from a server or performing calculations. Services can be injected into components, allowing them to use the service's functionality.

Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in Angular to manage dependencies between objects. It allows you to easily inject a service into a component, making it available for use. This is done by registering the service with Angular's dependency injection system, which then makes the service available to any component that needs it.

Modules: Modules are used to organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Each module contains a set of related components, directives, and services. This helps to manage the complexity of large applications by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Routing: Routing is used to define navigation within an Angular application. It allows you to define the routes that a user can take through the application, and specify which component should be displayed for each route. This makes it easy to create multi-page applications and to handle user interaction within those pages.
